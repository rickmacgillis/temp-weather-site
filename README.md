## Weather Site

This project is just an example site demonstrating how to pull the weather from DarkSky.net using coordinates from MapBox.com.

Feel free to use it as you fit.

This uses Node.js and Express, with the Request library to pull data from the APIs. It also uses Handlebars through the `hbs` module, and env-cmd for .env support.
